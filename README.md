# AutomateDataframe
this repo can generate a dataframe from two files:
* The first file contains the data
* The second file contains the configurations like the list of columns and the separator of the fields (; for example)
It also allows to :
* convert the fields to the desired format, 
* delete certain characters in the fields, etc ...
